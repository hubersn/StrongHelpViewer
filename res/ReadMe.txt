# In case you have not recognized it: this is StrongHelp format, the obvious choice for a StrongHelpViewer
#fh1:StrongHelpViewer
A viewer for RISC OS StrongHelp files written in Java Swing.

And also a converter for StrongHelp manuals into a bunch of HTML files for
viewing in your favourite browser.

And maybe soon a Server to provide any StrongHelp content to the world via
the magic of Java Servlet technology.
